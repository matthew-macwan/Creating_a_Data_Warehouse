# Creating_a_Data_Warehouse

### Project Summary

In this academic project, I created a data warehouse with a fact table and dimensions for 5 NBA players (Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeAaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell and Stephen Curry). The Excel spreadsheets were downloaded from basketball-reference.com. The script was executed from my local bash terminal and the data was inputted on my local machine in MySQL. This project was assigned in my CIS 4400 and I learned a ton about data architecture, how a data warehouse functions and how it is utilized by people accessing it, whether it be by creating data marts or running reports.
