# Creating_a_Data_Warehouse

In this academic project, I created a data warehouse that created fact tables and dimensions for 5 NBA players (Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, DeAaron Fox, Donovan Mitchell and Stephen Curry). The Excel spreadsheets were downloaded from basketball-reference.com. The script was executed from my local bash terminal and the data was inputted on my local machine. 



### File Description

- Chris_Paul.xlsx - Excel spreadsheet containing the game log info for Chris Paul
- Damian_Lillard.xlsx - Excel spreadsheet containing the game log info for Damian Lillard 
- DeAaron_Fox.xlsx - Excel spreadsheet containing the game log info for DeAaron Fox 
- Donovan_Mitchell.xlsx - Excel spreadsheet containing the game log info for Donovan Mitchell 
- NBA_ETL_script.py - Python script which takes the Excel spreadsheets and imports them into a MySQL database 
- Stephen_Curry.xlsx - Excel spreadsheet containing the game log info for Stephen Curry
